# SeaSurfaceTemperature-SST-

From Google Earth Engine (GEE) it was extracted the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data from 11 points of Corales del Rosario National Park/Cartagena/Colombia. The data is basically a daily mean of 13 days from different years. In this case January 1-13 of the year 1985, 2000, and 2020. The maximum Sea Surface Temperature (SST) around the 11 points of the park raised 1.72 ºC from 1985 to 2020 (27.90 to 29.07 ºC). These new temperatures affects corals (bleaching) and the diversity of other species.
