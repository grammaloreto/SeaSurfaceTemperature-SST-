**LSTM** is a type of recurrent neural networks **(RNN)** which are appropiate models to work with time-series data, very common in stock predictions and NLP. 
In this case, with sea surafece temperature (SST) of each 11 stations or points of interest in **Corales del Rosario Park**, a model is trained to predict accurate values of temperature and manage coral diseases which are associated to water temperatures.




**Graph1.** Observed and predicted values of the model for Station 1. The model is trained with sea surface temperatures from 1985-2020. The process is repeated for the other 10 points:

**Graph2.** With all temperatures of the 11 stations a single model was trained and the aproximation of real and predicted values are reflected:
